--- HOW TO UNBLOCK BLOCKED SITES USING SECURE DNS ---
 
## Introduction
Whenever you open a website, your device will send DNS request, most internet connection uses ISP's DNS servers by default, this mean your ISP & Government can affect how you access website.
 
This is how site blocking mostly works, and also if your ISP have technical problem it may result in some website become inaccesible.
The workaround for this block method is encrypting the DNS request that's sent from your devices so your ISP and government can't interfere what sites you are accessing.

------- IF DOESN'T WORK -------
 
If method above doesn't work it may because your ISP using other technique.

Try use tools like PowerTunnel (Bypass more block method but more complicated to setup)
Windows : https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel
Android : https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android

If still doesn't work you can also use VPN that will encrypt the entire traffic on your devices and almost guarantee will work, but it's not free.
